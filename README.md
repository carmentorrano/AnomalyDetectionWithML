# AnomalyDetectionWithML
Anomaly detection over network traffic with ML implemented with Python

The code contains a file created with Jupyter. This notebook can be used by installing the Anaconda software. 
The file contains code for anomaly detection on network traffic, specifically netflow. Detection is performed by means of Machine Learning techniques, in particular, applying feature selection and Isolation Forest as estimator. Pipelines are employed for feature extraction. Implementation is done in Python language, using Pandas and Scikit-Learn libraries.
